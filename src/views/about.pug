            | This project is a 3D furniture planner that allows a user to upload 3D models of a room
            | and objects and view how the objects in the room look in 3D. It is designed to be used
            | in conjunction with 3D room scanning applications like 
            em Polycam (https://poly.cam/). 
            | It supports several view modes including orthographic, perspective, and first-person.
            | It also implements features like measuring distance and exporting the 3D models.

        h2 How to Use
        p.description
            | Note: the demonstration is based on the usage of Polycam for scanning the room and any furnitures. 
            | Please refer to the software for a detailed instruction on how to get a better quality of the scan.
        h3 STEP 1: Scan the room and export (Skip if the data of the current floor plan has been updated)
        div.step-description
            p
                | Use the ROOM Mode in Polycam to scan the space. 
                | After scanning the room, skip the "process" option to obtain a clean model.  
                | This mode will provide a clean white model of the room with the existing furnitures in the scene.
                | Don't worry - keep the model as it is, and we will handle the cleaning process afterwards. 
                | After done scanning, export the gltf/obj file to your own device.

        h3 STEP 2: Scan the furniture and export
        div.step-description
            p 
                | Use the LiDAR Mode in Polycam to scan the furniture of your choice.
                | After done scanning, you can use the tools provided in the software to do some preliminary processing to make the model look cleaner.
                | When you are ready, export the gltf/obj file to your own device.
            img.pictures(src='/img/demo2.jpg')
        h3 STEP 3: Upload the glb/obj file
        div.step-description
            p 
                | To upload the floor plan you scanned, go to "FLOOR PLANS" - "&#43; Add new floor plan". Make sure to give it a name.
                | To upload the piece of furniture you scanned, go to "UPLOAD". Make sure to give it a name and place it in a category.
                | You can also make a new category of your choice inside the "FURNITURES" submenu.
                | You will be able to see the uploaded floor plans and furnitures under their designated submenu list.
                | Note: To delete any unwanted furnitures, click the trash can icon next to the item.

        h3 STEP 4: Load the room model and place the furniture model into the scene
        div.step-description 
            p 
                | To choose the floor plan, simply go to "FLOOR PLANS" and select the one that you would like to place your furnitures in. 
                | All pre-existing furnitures during scanning will be cleared at this stage. (NOTE: the cleaning process is based on 
                | the way Polycam output its room model, therefore this performance is not guaranteed if using other scanning softwares.) 
                | Next, go to "FURNITURES" - choose the category - select the item of your choice to place it into the scene.
